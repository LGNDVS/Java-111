PROJECT TITLE: InLab 1 by Logan Davis
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:  Modify the arrow
DATE: 9-2-2015

1. Error 1 has a compliling code problem with the word "system" spelled as "systm". 
It is an easy fix just by adding the e. It also has another compliling issue with the "print();" 
which is not needed in this code.

2. Error 2 does not have a Run-time or complile-time error. The code says the shape should be an arrow,
but it is really just a square. You can fix it either buy rearrage the code to take the shape of an arrow
or call it a square not an arrow.
